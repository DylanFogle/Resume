This project was part of a group project I worked on in school. The goal of the project was to create a fitness tracking app to track meals and workouts from a user.
The user would be able to add meals, workouts, and even their weights to the database. They would also be able to view the amount of calories burned/consumed
over a given period of time. The user would also be able to see the breakdown of their diet in regards to macro/micronutrients.
